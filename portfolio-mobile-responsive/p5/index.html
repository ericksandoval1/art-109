        The internet of the future is almost incomprehensible. Technology has advanced so rapidly in the past 100 years there is no telling how much more it will advance in the next 100 years. But I do have some predictions as to what it will end up being. First of all I do think it will be more important to our lives than ever. We will have our own identification number connected to the internet. Governments of the future will be forced to have this type of tracking. Violence and misinformation will be ever more common because of anonymity on the internet. This is something the governments of the world will no longer tolerate. Unfortunately for us, the citizens of countries that have to implement these rules, it will mean we will have less freedom. That will be the price we pay for having access to the internet. Another reason for the new identification system will be because of artificial intelligence. Even today artificial intelligence is creating content that is almost indistinguishable from human made content. 100 years from now this line will be invisible. AI will fill the internet with useless and junk content. Fake videos and misinformation will be very prevalent on the internet 100 years from now. There will be attempts to label things made by AI but that will be too hard to do, so content made by humans will have to be identified. 
        I believe the benefits will far outweigh the problems. Access to the internet gives way to financial opportunities. In 100 years most people will earn a living by one way or another through the internet. There will be automated machines and robots that will do most of the hard labor. Us humans will have more comfortable lives and work almost exclusively using the internet. It will have advanced so much that internet speeds worldwide will be in the gigabytes. No longer do people need to buffer a video to watch it or have to wait hours for a file to download. Work will become more efficient and that will benefit everyone in society.  We will access the internet largely through the same vehicles we have today. Phones and computers may become one in the same but they are too convenient for us to use to have anything else. They may take different shapes like phones being projection that comes out of a wearable ring or watch. Maybe they come in the form of some glasses, but that is how we will continue to access the internet. The same can be said about our homes or places of work. We will have no need for desktops and monitors. They are a waste of space and money. One thing I doubt will happen is we will not have an implant inside our brains, or head, or any other place in our body that connects to the internet in a major way. There would be some simple sensors but it will not be the main way we will reach the internet. I think this is because of fear. We do not want to give up our bodies anymore than we have to to companies and governments that will be in control and manufacture these devices. We have already given up our anonymity, why would we want to give up any more of ourselves?
        The social aspect of the internet will be more comparative then it is now. Even when I was in high school, social media was used to shame kids and bully each other. There was body shaming and unrealistic body ideals for both men and women. That will only increase in the future. With the inclusion of artificial intelligence, there will be unrealistic body expectations that are not even human. 
        If I were to imagine myself in this time of the internet I would like to think I would be able to resist the addictive nature. Up until now I have stopped using social media. I had an Instagram and Twitter but now I don’t post on them at all. I still have them but only to keep up with old friends. But if I were to jump 100 years, I do not think I could do that. The internet will be so much better and I will have to be a part of it. That's what I think most people will think in 100 years. They will have to be a part of the internet.
